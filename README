3. I spent around 3 hours in total. 
     1 hour coding the server 
     1 hour fixing bugs and formating the data, and printing correctly the format requiered. 
     1 hour testing with different inputs, and in different Rutgers computers. 
   I have some trouble detecting the connection from the users, and sending the rigth information. 
   I solved by using a dictictory and excepting when the key value does not exits in the dictionary.
